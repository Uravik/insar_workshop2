    """The main function for running LiCSAlert is monitoring mode.  It was designed to work with LiCSAR interferograms, but could be used with 
    any product that creates interfegorams that LiCSBAS can use (which is used for the time series calculation.  )
    
    One of the key functions called in this function is "run_LiCSAlert_status", which returns LiCSAlert status.  
       
    Inputs:
        LiCSAlert_bin | string | Path to folder containing LiCSAlert functions.  
        ICASAR_bin | string | Path to folder containing ICASAR functions.  
        LiCSAR_frames_dir | string | path to the folder containing LiCSAR frames.  Needs trailing /
        LiCSAlert_volcs_dir | string | path to the folder containing each volcano.  Needs trailing /
        override_settings | dict of dicts| Each volcano directory has a .txt file of settings, but by passing settings here, they are applied to all volcanoes.  Mainly useful for 
                                            changing the downsampling factor so that processing is fast and debudding easy.  Contains a dict of icasar settings, and licsalert settings.  
    Returns:
        Directory stucture.
